## üìÑ Description
<br>

This project focuses on continuing the development of a website for an association called TaskLinker by adding a user authentication system.
The code is based on Project No. 8 from the PHP Symfony Application Developer course @OpenClassrooms, where the initial work was done in PHP without a framework.
The website's purpose is to provide a CRM solution for creating projects, tasks, and user management.
During this project, I added a user authentication system to secure access to the various functionalities of the site.

Retrieve the ports of your MySQL container and add them to your .env file under `DATABASE_URL`
6. Start the server

```
## üî•Ô∏è Usage

The project is a website developed in PHP, HTML, and CSS.
To start using it, visit the local URL of your Symfony server, typically <a href="127.0.0.1:8000/">127.0.0.1:8000/</a>.
You can sign up or log in with an already existing user account.
Among the different accounts created with the fixtures, there is an administrator account:
- email: admin@tasklinker.com
- password: password)
All users created with the fixtures have the password "password".

Administrators can add projects, tasks, and users.
Users can view the projects and tasks assigned to them.
